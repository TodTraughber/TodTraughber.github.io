	<h1>Philosophy of Awards at FIRST Competitions</h1>
</div>
<p>In this section, we will examine the role of the <i>FIRST</i> judge and the lens through which the organization views awards.</p>
<p>Helping you with the judging process is the Judge Adviser. This individual is an experienced volunteer and specially trained to help you succeed. The Judge Adviser is <b>NOT</b> a judge in that they do not conduct interviews or vote on awards. Their main job is to work with judges to help them .</p>
