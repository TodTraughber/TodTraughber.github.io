<h2>Role of the FIRST Judge:</h2>

<p class = "grey"><b><i>FIRST Ambassador:</i></b> The Judges are ambassadors for the FIRST mission throughout the competition. Give positive strokes to the adult mentors and students. It is an honor and a pleasure to be a Judge Ambassador.</p>

<p><b><i>Role Model:</i></b> Some students have never met an engineer, scientist or professional business leader.  FIRST relies on individuals who have excelled in their career fields to be the role models for our students to emulate.  During your time as a Judge, demonstrate a sense of humor, talk about your own personal path to success, share real life-experiences, etc.  Remember the mission â€“ inspire the students.</p>
