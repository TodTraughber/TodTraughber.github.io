<h2>Role of the FIRST Judge:</h2>

<p class = "grey"><b><i>Detective:</i></b> It is up to the Judges to discover the contestants deserving of the awards.  They must find the facts and sort them out in minimum time amid utmost confusion.  Remember many robots can be similar and have almost identical features.  It is your job to find the differences, document them and be ready to advocate for your favorites using the data youâ€™ve gathered.</p>

<p><b><i>Reporter:</i></b> Part of the Judge duties include writing a short award script that explains why each team was recognized for their award.  This script is read at the award ceremony; therefore your notes will be used to construct a succinct and informative description of each team's performance. Take plenty of detailed notes!</p>
