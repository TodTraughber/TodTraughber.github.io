<h2>Role of the FIRST Judge:</h2>

<p class = "clearRight">It is important to note that <u><b><i>FIRST</i> JUDGES ARE NOT REFEREES</b></u> of the Competition! Accordingly, although you may find it fun and useful in evaluating teams for consideration of certain awards, Judges do not need to understand the intricate rules applying to the robots participating in the Competition. Refer all game questions that you may receive to the Head Referee.</p>
