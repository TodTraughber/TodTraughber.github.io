<h2>Awards Based Upon the Machine:</h2>

<h2 class = "noAfterMargin"><u>Industrial Design Award</u></h2>
<i>sponsored by General Motors</i>

<p>Celebrates form and function in an efficiently designed machine that effectively addresses the game challenge.</p>

<p><i>Guidelines:</i><ul>
<li>The design is elegant and efficient (simple/executable) and practical. The entire machine reflects a system design approach, i.e., the overall machine design addresses the many functional systems that must operate together.</li>
<br/>
<li>Designing the machine contributes to the team’s success in FIRST Robotics – not just in performance on the field of competition.</li>
<br/>
<li>Reliability and maintainability are considered in design. For example, it is capable of withstanding the rigors of the contest and servicing is easy.</li>
<br/>
<li>The entire machine design, or the detailed process used to develop the design, is worthy of this recognition, and not just a single component.</li></ul></p>
